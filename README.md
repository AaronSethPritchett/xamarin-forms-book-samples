# xamarin-forms-book-samples
Sample code for *Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms*. The book can be downloaded from http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/creating-mobile-apps-xamarin-forms/.

This **macos** branch is an early state, but is devoted to upgrading the book solutions to include projects that target the Mac OS.
