# xamarin-forms-book-samples

Sample code for *Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms*. The book can be downloaded from http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/creating-mobile-apps-xamarin-forms/.

This **macos** branch is an early state, but is devoted to upgrading the book solutions to include projects that target the Mac OS.

Currently, many of the programs in the chapters up through 27 or so have been converted but not tested. Libraries and platform-specific code has not been converted.
